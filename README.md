# Next.js Personal Website Template with JSON Resume

A modern, customizable personal website template built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This template originated from my personal website project, which was developed in collaboration with AI assistance. As someone who benefited from AI pair programming, I wanted to give back to the community by sharing this template that combines best practices, modern technologies, and an excellent developer experience.

This template uses the JSON Resume standard for easy resume management and includes features like theme customization, analytics integration, and a "Buy Me a Coffee" button. If you're a developer looking to quickly set up a professional online presence this template provides a solid foundation.
